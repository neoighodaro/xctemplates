# XCTemplates

This is a simple bash script to customise Xcode templates. This is a developer tool and needs a certain level of technical knowledge to use. If you are not comfortable with the command line, this is not for you.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./run.sh` from the root of the repository
3. Follow the instructions

## Why do I need this?
Xcode does not make it easy to customise the header of the files it generates. Sometimes, we may need something more than the default header. This script allows you to customise the header of the files generated by Xcode.

## How does it work?
This script uses the `find` command to find all the templates in the Xcode application bundle. It then replaces the header of each template with the header you provide.

The script also creates a backup of the original template files in case you want to revert back to the original templates. The back up is stored in `~/xctemplates_backup`. In this directory, you can also find the modified files for each backup. This is useful if you want to see what files were modified.

If something goes wrong, you can always restore the original templates manually as the script does not have the ability to restore the templates.
